Introduction
============

What is it?
-----------

Pepper is a general purpose data-driven game engine, written from scratch in orthodox C++ with a minimalistic and data-oriented design philosophy in mind.

It is loosely inspired by Bitsquid (now Stingray) engine and its design principles.

Supported platforms
-------------------

* Android (14+, ARM)
* Linux
* Windows

Basic concepts
==============

The source directory
--------------------

The source directory contains all the files that make up the game.

.. code::

  .
  ├── lua
  |   └── game.lua
  ├── boot.config
  ├── boot.package
  └── global.physics_config

The boot directory and the boot.config file
-------------------------------------------

Any directory containing the file named ``boot.config`` is a boot directory.
The ``boot.config`` file specifies a number of options.

In the example below, the engine is told to load the package ``boot`` and run the Lua script ``lua/game``.

.. code::

  boot_package = "boot"      // Package to load on boot
  boot_script  = "lua/game"  // Lua script to execute on boot

Within `the source directory`_, there can be an arbitrary number of boot directories. You can specify the boot directory using the switch ``--boot-dir``.

The bundle directory
--------------------

Pepper reads source data from `the source directory`_ and compiles it into efficient binary representation.
The result of the compilation process is stored in the bundle directory.

.. code::

  .
  ├── data                                   // <- Contains compiled data files
  |   ├── a14e8dfa2cd117e2-9dea40fdc2245efc  // <- Compiled file
  |   ├── 72e3cc03787a11a1-0b2f08fe66e395c0  // <- Another compiled file
  |   └── ...
  ├── temp                                   // <- Temporary files from data compilers
  └── last.log                               // <- Text log from the last engine execution

The .bundleignore file
----------------------

Many programs store metadata files alongside edited files. This is often the case with text editors and version control systems.

When Pepper bumps into unknown files in the source directory, it quits the compilation and reports an error.

The ``.bundleignore`` file specifies files that Pepper should ignore when compiling data.

Example:

.. code::

  # This is a comment.

  # Blank lines are ignored.
  # Everything else is simple glob pattern (*, ?).
  *.txt

Units of measurement
--------------------

Pepper uses MKS (meters, kilograms and seconds) units and radians for angles.

Command line reference
======================

	``-h --help``
		Display the help.

	``-v --version``
		Display engine version.

	``--source-dir <path>``
		Use <path> as the source directory for resource compilation.

		The <path> must be absolute.

	``--bundle-dir <path>``
		Use <path> as the destination directory for compiled resources.

		The <path> must be absolute.

	``--boot-dir <path>``
		Boot the engine with the ``boot.config`` from given <path>.

		The <path> must be relative.

	``--compile``
		Do a full compile of the resources.

		When using this option you must also specify ``--platform``, ``--source-dir`` and ``--bundle-dir``.

	``--platform <platform>``
		Compile resources for the given <platform>.
		Possible values for <platform> are:

		* ``android``
		* ``linux``
		* ``windows``

	``--continue``
		Run the engine after resource compilation.

	``--console-port <port>``
		Set port of the console.

		When no port is specified, the engine uses the port 10001.

	``--wait-console``
		Wait for a console connection before starting up.

	``--parent-window <handle>``
		Set the parent window <handle> of the main window.

		This option should be used only by the tools.

	``--server``
		Run the engine in server mode.

		When using this option you must also specify ``--source-dir``.

	``--run-unit-tests``
		Run unit tests and quit. Available only on ``linux`` and ``windows``.
