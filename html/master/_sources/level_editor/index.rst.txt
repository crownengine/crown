Level Editor
============

The Level Editor is the first editor you encounter when starting Crown, and it
is where you will spend most of your time when working on Crown projects. As
the name suggests, its primary purpose is to help you create and edit Levels,
but it also serves as a hub for browsing project files and a launchpad for
accessing other specialized editors and tools. Last but not least, it can
start your game, hot-reload any resources and communicate with it via the
Console.
