Crown is designed to minimize resource usage and conserve battery life
whenever possible. It reduces unnecessary background activity and adapts
performance to the current workload to avoid wasting power.

The following requirements are intended as a baseline for a smooth editor

on each game's complexity and can often be significantly reduced through
careful optimization/tuning.
