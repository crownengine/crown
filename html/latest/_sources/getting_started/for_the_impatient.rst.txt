When you first launch the Crown Editor and no projects exist, Crown
automatically generates a temporary project and opens it. This lets you
explore the graphical interface immediately without any extra steps.

.. figure:: images/temp_project.png
   :align: center

   The temporary project created on first launch.

At this point you can either jump straight into the :ref:`level_editor` to get
a feel for its features, or close the temporary project and create a new one
yourself, for example, starting from a featureful template.

To close the temporary project, choose ``File`` -> ``Close Project``:

.. figure:: images/temp_project_close.png
   :align: center

   Closing the temporary project from the File menu.

You will be asked whether to save or discard the temporary project. Choose
``Save`` to keep your work (the project will then appear in the Projects
List), or ``Close without Saving`` to discard it. After closing the temporary
project, Crown opens the Projects List, where you can :ref:`create a new
project <create_new_project>`.

   Confirmation dialog asking whether to save the temporary project.

Tip: If you plan to continue working on what you created during this session,
save the temporary project before closing. If you were just experimenting,
discarding it is fine; you can always start a new project from a template
later.
