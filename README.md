Crown is a general purpose data-driven game engine, written from scratch in [orthodox C++](https://gist.github.com/bkaradzic/2e39896bc7d8c34e042b) with a minimalistic and data-oriented design philosophy in mind.

It is loosely inspired by Bitsquid (now Stingray) engine and its design principles; the current Lua API is similar to that of Bitsquid but this engine is *not* meant to be its clone *nor* to be API compatible with it.
