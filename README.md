The flexible game engine. [![Build Status](https://github.com/dbartolini/crown/workflows/build_and_test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dbartolini/crown/actions)
=====================================

Crown is a general purpose and data-driven game engine, written in [orthodox
C++](https://gist.github.com/bkaradzic/2e39896bc7d8c34e042b) with a minimalistic
and data-oriented design philosophy in mind.

Crown isn't tied to a particular game type or genre but instead it offers a set
of generic primitives and facilities to help you create a wide gamut of
interactive 2D and 3D products.
