     * the top of the stack. When you create the table with lua_newtable(),
     * the table gets pushed into the top of the stack. When you push the
     * index and then the cell value, the stack looks like:
     *
     * <- [stack bottom] -- table, index, value [top]
     *
     * So the -1 will refer to the cell value, thus -3 is used to refer to
     * the table itself. Note that lua_rawset() pops the two last elements
     * of the stack, so that after it has been called, the table is at the
     * top of the stack.
